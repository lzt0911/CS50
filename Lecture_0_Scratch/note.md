## Unicode
* Unicode是ASCII的扩展，用来表示世界上大部分的文字系统。
* Unicode includes not only special characters, but emoji as well.
* For example, the unicode for a generic thumbs up is U+1F44D（U+代表unicode编码）. However, the following represents the same thumbs up with a different skin tone: U+1F44D U+1F3FD.

## Artificial Intelligence人工智能
* large language models look at patterns in large blocks of language. Such language models attempt to create a best guess of what words come after one another or alongside one another.
## Scratch
* Scratch is a visual programming language developed by MIT.
